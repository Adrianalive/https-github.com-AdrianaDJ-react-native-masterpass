# Tenant Restoration Policy

::: note
If you are considering deleting your tenant, please see our [Resetting/Deleting Tenant](/tutorials/delete-reset-tenant) page for alternative options.
:::

As explicitly noted during the tenant deletion process, **deleted tenants cannot be restored** at this time.

::: note
If you have deleted your tenant and you require a certain domain or unique domain for branding purposes, we recommend configuring a [custom domain](/custom-domains) for your new tenant.
